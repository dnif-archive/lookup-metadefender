#### Lookups integrated with MetaDefender

##### Retrieve File Scan reports by MD5/SHA1/SHA256 Hash

Report on scan results of MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256 hash provided
- input : a md5/sha1/sha256 hash will retrieve the most recent report on a given sample

[Report for File Hash](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1N2Vizf5e_CGNyzwyOBacAhDi8WpVCMPG)

```
_fetch $Filehash from threatsample limit 1
>>_lookup metadefender get_hash_report $Filehash
```

The Lookup call returns output in the following structure for available data
